Hi!

Like JS? We're gonna organize JavaScript themed meetups in Nis!

Every month, we'll get together at a venue, have a few JS related talks, have some coffee (or beer) and discuss interesting things.

Entrance will always be free, duh.

[Anyone can talk at Nis JS event](https://github.com/nisjs/cfp).
